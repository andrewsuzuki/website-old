I am a full-stack web developer. To me, this means I can craft both the front and back end of websites and web apps. I can do anything from making small changes to business websites to custom web apps. This includes:

* REST APIs (Node.js)
* Single-page web apps (AngularJS)
* MVC-backend web apps (Laravel)
* Simple static sites/blogs, like this one
* Wordpress websites
* Various other CMSs (content management)
* Mobile apps for iOS and Android (Cordova)
* Responsive interfaces, esp. Bootstrap
* Basic web/graphic design
* Scrapers

Specifically, these are the technologies I am most familiar with:

* HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Bootstrap
* PHP, Laravel, Wordpress
* Javascript, Node.js, Express, AngularJS, jQuery, Gulp
* MySQL, MongoDB
* Python, Ruby
* Git, Vagrant, Linux, OS X

Nourish is a web and mobile app for UConn students to manage their dining experiences. It periodically scrapes UConn's dining hall pages and allows the data to be searched or saved by users. Students can be notified when their favorite foods are on the menu in any dining hall.

It consists of a Node-powered web API, an AngularJS front end, and a mobile app powered by Apache Cordova, Ionic, and AngularJS.

#### Western Mass IAEI

This is an example of my ability to take a designer's mockup and turn it into a functioning Wordpress site. Site content is easily changed through the Wordpress backend.

Additionally, the layout is responsive. This means its structure changes depending on the browser window size for a better experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

#### Andrewsuzuki.com

This website is an example of my own design abilities, with inspiration from Medium.com. The focus is placed on the easy-reading textual content.

This is a static site, generated by a custom Gulp workflow. You can learn more about the technicalities [here](https://github.com/andrewsuzuki/andrewsuzuki.github.io).

#### Vessel
