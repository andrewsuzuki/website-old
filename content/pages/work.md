I am a full-stack web developer. To me, this means I can craft both the front and back end of websites and web apps. I can do anything from making small changes to business websites to custom web apps. This includes:

* REST APIs (Node.js)
* Single-page web apps (AngularJS)
* MVC-backend web apps (Laravel)
* Simple static sites/blogs, like this one
* Wordpress websites
* Various other CMSs (content management)
* Mobile apps for iOS and Android (Cordova)
* Basic web/graphic design

Specifically, these are the technologies I am most familiar with:

* HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Bootstrap
* PHP: Laravel, Wordpress
* Javascript: Node.js, Express, AngularJS, jQuery, Gulp
* Databases: MySQL, MongoDB
* Python and Ruby
* Git, Vagrant, Linux, OS X
