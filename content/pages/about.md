My name is Andrew Suzuki. I'm from New Haven, Connecticut. I'm a programmer, touring/racing cyclist, and musician. Find out more about these things below.

I'm currently attending the University of Connecticut, heading towards a major in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.

I've been working primarily as a freelance full-stack web developer since 2010. You can find some of my recent work on the <a href="/work">Work</a> page.

#### Programming

I picked up HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and MySQL in my early teens.

I started working as a freelance full-stack web developer in 2010. I've done everything from Photoshop conversions to Wordpress themes to web apps.

Along the way, I picked up other languages. The full list, ordered by familiarity, is:

PHP, CSS, HTML, Javascript, Python, Java, C, Ruby, Clojure, Sass, ChucK

I'm also familiar with some frameworks/platforms/libraries. These include:

Laravel, Wordpress, Bootstrap, jQuery, AngularJS, Node.js, Express

Vim is my code editor of choice when used through tmux and iTerm2. I use OS X and Ubuntu Linux.

#### Cycling

In the summer of 2014, I rode my bicycle on a 4,000-mile, 42-day trek across the United States. I started in New Haven, Connecticut and biked to San Francisco, California. It was a self-supported tour &ndash; I hauled around 70 pounds of gear and mostly camped off the side of the road. You wouldn't believe how few showers I took.

Aside from touring, I also race road bikes with the UConn Cycling Team and compete with major schools all around the Northeast. I try to ride my bike every day.

#### Music

I've studied piano for 10 years, euphonium for 8 years, bass for 6 years, and guitar for 4 years. I have played in various concert bands, orchestras, piano trios, and rock bands.

Composition has been an on-and-off thing for me. I was a finalist in the NAfME Eastern Conference Composition Competition and performed my piece in Baltimore. Another piece of mine was toured by the Yale Percussion Trio. More recently, I've produced works for computer, most of which can be found on [my SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/andrewsuzuki).
