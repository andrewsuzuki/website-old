This is my personal portfolio and blog, powered by the excellent static site generator [Hexo](https://hexo.io).

I'm using [hexojs/hexo-deployer-git](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-deployer-git) to deploy the site to the [master branch](https://github.com/andrewsuzuki/andrewsuzuki.github.io/tree/master), which is automatically hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Check out the site here (until I transfer my domain): [andrewsuzuki.github.io](https://andrewsuzuki.github.io)
